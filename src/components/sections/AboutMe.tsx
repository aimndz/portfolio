          <span className="text-p-default">artist</span> who sees programming
          the same way I see art. I was an artist first before diving into
          development, so that creative mindset naturally carried over. I also
          love <span className="text-p-default">solving problems</span> (which I
          sometimes create myself), which makes coding the perfect blend of
          logic and creativity for me.

          In my spare time, you&apos;ll probably find me learning something new
          on tech (lol nerd). Other than that, you&apos;ll find me playing
          basketball, drawing, or playing video games. Whether it&apos;s art,
          code, or strategy, I believe in creating, innovating, and having fun
          along the way.{" "}
