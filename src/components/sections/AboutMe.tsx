        I am a full-stack developer with a passion for both coding and
        creativity. I specialize in crafting pixel-perfect user interfaces that
        seamlessly combine intuitive design with solid engineering. My best work
        emerges at the crossroads of design and development, where I create
        experiences that are not only visually striking but also optimized for
        performance and usability.
